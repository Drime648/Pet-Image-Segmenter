# Pet-Image-Segmenter

An AI model that can take in a picture of an animal and figure out exactly which pixel of that image is part of the animal, and which part is the background. It will segment the image so you can see the background in green, outline of the animal in yellow, and the actual body of the animal in purple color. This was trained on the oxford_iiit_pet dataset.
